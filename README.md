# Linedraw
This project came from pure boredom and the need to try new things  
# What is it?
Linedraw was made to calculate the distance from a point to the other  
# How does it work?
It checks the coordinates of each point and using the pythagorean theorem and other cool math stuff calculates what it was suposed to calculate  
# Why Linedraw
Because i had no other idea.  
# How do i use?
first you need to download the header file: https://github.com/GoldenStarGamer/Linedraw/blob/87bde4a7ec36eb0af801905f01198d7c983b12ea/GSLinedraw/Linedraw.h  
then you need to include the header. create an object: `Linedraw linedrawer;`, replacing "linedrawer" with any keyword of your choosing.  
then just use `linedrawer.Dir(<point1 x>,<point1 y>,\<point2 x>,\<point2 y>);` and it will return the distance.
# Propper Docummentation soon

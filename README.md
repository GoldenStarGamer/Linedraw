# Linedraw
This project came from pure boredom and the needing to try new things  
# What is it?
Linedraw was made to calculate the distance from a point to the other  
# How does it work?
It checks the coordinates of each point and using the pythagorean theorem and other cool math stuff calculates what it was suposed to calculate  
# Why Linedraw
Because i had no other idea.  
# How do i use?
first you need to download the header file: https://github.com/GoldenStarGamer/Linedraw/blob/87bde4a7ec36eb0af801905f01198d7c983b12ea/GSLinedraw/Linedraw.h  
then you need to include the header, create an object: "Linedraw \<something>;", replacing something with any keyword of your choosing,  
then just use "\<something>.Dir(\<pov x>,\<pov y>,\<target x>,\<target y>);" and it will return the distance. Note that pov, stands for point of view, that means the one that you want to move, and the target being the point that you want to go to, x means "x coordinate", same for y.
# Propper Docummentation soon

# Linedraw
This project came from pure boredom and the needing to try new things  
# What is it?
Linedraw was made to calculate the distance from a point to the other and the required clockwise rotation to face the second object  
# How does it work?
It checks the coordinates of each point and using the pythagorean theorem and other cool math stuff calculates what it was suposed to calculate  
However, for the angles, it has to check other stuff because the cool math stuff only calculates the angle of the triangle, not the actual angle  
So we add 90 or/and angles so it gets it correct.
# Why Linedraw
Because i had no other idea.  

# Propper Docummentation soon
